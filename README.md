## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the built app by `node build/server.js`.\

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles Node.js in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\
When re-run this command, typescript will remove all existing files in the `build` folder,\
And compile the app again.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
